It collects primary and secondary references to "Justaism" (pronounced "just-a-ism"), a term [coined](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7784) by Scott Aaronson to (pejoratively) refer to deflationary claims made by skeptics that LLMs are "just...": "next-token predictors", "function approximators", or "stochastic parrots", and thus lack some
essential cognitive capacities that humans possess.

### Primary instances of Justaism

**Note:** The following will vary in their level of deflationism, question-begging, and general justaic strength. To aid in 
conveying this diversity, we have included a Justaism strength rating ("strong", "moderate", "weak") in square brackets 
for each instance. These ratings are based not just on the quote itself, but also on the broader context in which it was made.

"The widespread enthusiasm for LLMs should be tempered by an awareness that they are not actually simulating human intelligence [29,32,33]. LLMs simply predict the next phrase or sentence, given what they have been exposed to in the training data. Consequently, they tend to output an ‘average’ of what the internet or popular books tend to say"<br>

"A bare-bones LLM does not really know anything because all it does, at a fundamental level, is sequence prediction."<br>
[Shanahan, 2024, Communications of the ACM](https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3624724) [moderate]

"As sequence predictors, these models draw on the underlying statistical distribution of previously generated text to stitch together vectorized symbol strings based on the probabilities of their co-occurrence4. They therefore lack the communicatively embodied and relational functionings that are a prerequisite of scientific meaning-making, in the barest sense."<br>
[Birhane et al., 2023, Nature Reviews Physics](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-023-00581-4) [moderate]

"LLMs are not trained to understand language as humans do. By ‘learning’ the statistical associations between words as they have been used by humans, GPT-3 develops an ability to successfully predict which word best completes a phrase or sentence."<br>
[Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023, Nature Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-023-02448-8) [weak]

"In our view, they [LLMs] operate over ‘fossilized’ outputs of human language (text token) and seem capable of implementing some automatic computations pertaining to distributional statistics, but are incapable of understanding due to their lack of generative world models"<br>
[Marcus et al., 2023, arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.00109) [moderate]

"An AI doesn’t contemplate your question. When you understand how they work, even at a superficial level, you realize it’s just a statistical algorithm. It’s a very cool and impressive statistical algorithm, but it doesn’t think or consider. Some people are surprised to learn that there’s no ‘mind’ there at all."<br>

"First we should ask the question, have large language models achieved anything, anything in this domain [natural language understanding]. Answer: no, they've achieved zero. [...] GPT-3 has done nothing. With a supercomputer it can look at 45 terabytes of data and find some superficial regularities, which then, it can imitate. "<br>

"Our learned ability to process and find meaning in conversational text
means that we slip, and often forget that we are not dealing with a human, and
very quickly we anthropomorphise the bot. We may attribute personality traits
to it. We may attribute an intended meaning to the generated text. Anthropomorphism of this nature is not trivial and can have serious consensuses, indeed
previous research has highlighted people’s tendency to “overtrust” robotic systems with potentially disastrous outcomes [50].." <br>

“ChatGPT ‘writes’ by estimating each new word in a sequence by statistical ranking, given the probabilities of certain words and word-pairs in its training data.19 This process doesn’t seem to require attributing knowledge, belief, or intention to ChatGPT to explain any of the processing." <br>
[van Woudenberg et al., 2024, Philosophy and Technology](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-024-00715-1) [moderate]

"Like the prisoners in Plato’s famous cave, deep-learning systems explore the shadows on the cave wall and learn to accurately predict their movements. They lack the understanding that the observed shadows are mere projections of three-dimensional objects moving in a three-dimensional space. Strong AI requires this understanding." <br>

'It doesn't matter how much you scale AI you will never have a formula that can definitely describe, model, represent (whichever terminology
you wish to use) life. [...] We as humans, I think there is something very profound in our being, in our essence – call it consciousness if you will – we can't really define
it, we can't really grasp it, but it's part of us. I think that's how we have got here.' <br>

### Secondary references to Justaism 

In response to the survey item – "Some generative model trained only on text, given enough data and computational resources, could understand natural
language in some non-trivial sense." – 51% agreed and the remaining 49% disagreed (out of 480 active NLP researcher respondents).<br>
[Michael et al., 2022, arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.12852)

'there is a small but growing belief that a next-token predicting model is merelyan impressive improv artist that cannot truly model human thought. [...] This criticism has been floating around as an informal viewpoint (LeCun, 2024; Bubeck et al., 2023).'<br>
[Bachmann & Nagarajan, 2024, arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.06963) 

"I suspect that the general public, including many journalists reporting on machine learning, aren’t even aware of the distinction between training the model and using it to make inferences. One simply reads that ChatGPT, or any other comparable LLM, generates text by predicting the next word. This mis-communication is a MAJOR blunder." <br>
